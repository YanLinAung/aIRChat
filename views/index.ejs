        IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a mature internet communication system that has been around for
        a long time.  When people talk about IRC, the phrase is often used to encompass all of the
        client programs that people use to chat with one another, servers that handle commands and
        messages, and the protocol itself that defines how clients and servers can talk to each other
        in a meaningful way. IRC is very simple, but it is likely somewhat different to other chat
        applications you may have used before, but there are only a few key terms you need to be
        familiar with you get started!

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Server</dt>
      <dd>
        A server runs software that handles commands and messages from users, making changes
        to various settings, and relaying messages to other users.
      </dd>
      <dt>Channel</dt>
      <dd>
        A channel is basically a chat room.  Users gather in channels to talk about their
        shared interests.  Anyone can create a channel simply by joining it.  If the channel
        you want to join doesn't exist, it will be created!
      </dd>
      <dt>User</dt>
      <dd>
        A user is anyone present in a channel.  Users can send messages to each other
        privately or to anyone in a channel, and they can also create new channels.
        Users are identified on a server by their "nick" (short for nickname).
      </dd>
      <dt>Operators</dt>
      <dd>
        IRC allows for individual users in a channel to be provided with special privileges
        that give them the ability to kick, ban, and invite other users among other things.
        When you create a new channel, you are automatically made its operator.
      </dd>
      <dt>Highlighting</dt>
      <dd>
        When a user writes a message containing another user's nick, that user's IRC client
        will often display a special kind of notification informing them that somone is
        trying to contact them directly.  aIRChat keeps a count in a red box next to the
        name of the channel of the number of times you have been highlighted since reading
        the messages in that channel, and by tinting message bubbles containing your nick red.
